# Problems and Fixes!
Documentation and solutions to problems I run into. 

### Theme not Showing on Github Pages
A problem I ran into this week was my theme showing up on my local server not showing up on the github pages server. Instead, it was a totally unformatted page. I spent a while checking with my partner (because her theme was working) and trying fixes from online sources. However, I nothing seemed to work. When I checked the console, and it said the css file couldn't be accessed... it turned out that in the html file the css file was trying to be accessed from the ROOT directory with the /assets... we must access it from the relative directory with assets...
